Add your answers to the questions below.

1. What is the runtime complexity of your ring buffer's `append` method?

O(1)

2. What is the space complexity of your ring buffer's `append` function?

no new variables so no new memory is used

3. What is the runtime complexity of your ring buffer's `get` method?

O(n)

4. What is the space complexity of your ring buffer's `get` method?

the array is filled with non None values every time the method is called

5. What is the runtime complexity of the provided code in `names.py`?

O(n^2)?

6. What is the space complexity of the provided code in `names.py`?

the names variables use memory as well as the declared duplicates array 

7. What is the runtime complexity of your optimized code in `names.py`?

O(n)

8. What is the space complexity of your optimized code in `names.py`?

I used same as the provided code plus the new variables a, b
